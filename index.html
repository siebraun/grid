        <h1>How to Survive off the Grid</h1>
        <p>
          So, you want to know how to live off the grid. It’s simple really.
          Move to the woods, build a cabin, throw on some solar panels and wind
          turbine for power, and drill a well. Then start raising chickens,
          cows, and pigs, and sit on your front porch while sipping coffee and
          staring out at the beautiful natural wilderness around you. Easy,
          right? Not really.

          It takes planning, preparation, and work to make the move off grid.
          And once you’re there, the work will continue with the maintenance and
          upkeep of your homestead. Let’s make this as simple as possible by
          breaking down, step-by-step, the most important things you need for
          off grid living. It all goes back to the basics. Living a sustainable
          life while being self-sufficient is key.
