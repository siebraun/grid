          First, you’ll need a good location. How do you find that? Well, we
          wrote an in-depth article explaining How To Find Land For Living Off
          The Grid. It details how to find and pick the perfect property for
          your needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next thing you need is shelter. This is a fundamental need every
          human being requires to survive. Your off grid home can come in the
          form of a cabin, a traditional wood-frame home, a tiny house, a cob
          house, an Earthship, a strawbale home, or even a yurt, which is
          basically a large octagonal-shaped tent.

          A good clean potable water source is vital for living off the grid.
          You will most likely not have access to city water or municipal county
          water sources on your land so you must choose a piece of land that
          either has a natural water source, or where it’s convenient to haul
          water.
        </p>

        <p>
          The other resource you need is a water collection system. This could
          be something as simple as rain barrel water catchment attached to your
          home’s gutter, or a more complex cistern water collection system that
          collects all the rainwater from your roof.

          Grow your own food! Since you most likely will not have everyday
          access to grocery stores and convenience stores to shop for food,
          you’ll benefit by growing your own in a garden and/or greenhouse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Off grid power. This is where the actual off grid part comes in. Since
          you will not be connected to the power grid, you will need to be able
          to generate electricity yourself. A few 250 Watt solar panels and a
          good 250-500 Watt wind turbine will probably suffice for most homes
          depending on how much power you use at once.
        </p>

          No one likes talking about it, but it’s a fact of life. You’re going
          to have to deal with waste disposal. You’ll have to have some sort of
          composting waste disposal system, or you’ll dig a traditional septic
          system. Either way, you will have to follow local and federal
          guidelines on waste disposal.
        </p>

        <p>
          Perhaps the most important thing you need to live off grid is the
          mindset and the will. It’s easy to talk about and say you’d love to
          live off the grid, free from the confines and drudgery of modern life.
          The idea of that kind of freedom can be enticing. It takes hard work
          though, and lots of it.
